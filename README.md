### Notes
The biggest challenge was adding the bonus feature where a user can tap a poster in the collection view to see a detailed screen of that movie. This is because when completing this part, I had to go back and think through the steps taken in the video, which I was, honestly, blindly following. Eventually, by looking through the problem more deeply and understanding the challenges and workarounds, I was able to get this done. This challenge led to actually understanding how the process works and was really helpful.
