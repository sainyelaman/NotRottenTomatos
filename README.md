### Notes
The biggest challenge was adding the bonus feature where a user can tap a poster in the collection view to see a detail screen of that movie. This is because when completeing this part, I had to go back and think thorugh the steps taken in the video which I was, honestly, blindly following. This challenge led to actually understand how the process works, and was really helpful

### Notes
The biggest challenge was that for some reason the terminal command lines below were not working. Someone did mention the same issue on slack. Somehow, with magic, I got it fixed. But if someone asked me how - I wouldn't have the answer.
